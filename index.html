    right away that there’s such a thing as an art of motorcycle
    maintenance.</p>
 <blockquote>Art is anything you can do well. <br></br>
 Anything where there are options for doing it well or poorly. <br></br>
 ~ Robert Pirsig</blockquote>
 <p class="center">And there are very few things in this world that don’t have options for
    doing it well. You can make an art out of anything. And I think that making
    an art out of your technical life is solving the problem of technology.</p>
 <p class="center">Quotes from Robert Pirsig, author of 'Zen and the art of motorcycle
    maintenance'</p>
 <blockquote>Live clean, let your works be seen. <br></br>
 Stand firm or go feed worm. <br></br>
